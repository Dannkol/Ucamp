An  online course platform for use in the campuslands network, developed and powered by the camper community (students and employees).

# Product Spec

## 👀 Problem

> **How can we distribute courses and educational content in the camper community?**
> 
- Using educational platforms
- Using server dircord
- Create our own network to distribute the content in our internal network

---

## 💭 Proposal

> **To improve, the proposal involves the creation of our own content distribution system, using as a base platforms used in the market and discord.**
> 
- In this system it should be possible to create courses with classes containing title, summary and content that can be video, text or both.
- It must be possible to log in and register with discord.
- Users can view or create courses
- Views should be simple and responsive
